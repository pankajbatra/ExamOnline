To administer the test go to administrators section.and we have created a admin account for u that is

in ur control panel u can adminster tests e.g. create new test,delete tests made by u, start the tests, add/delete/add question to ur tests etc. whenever u create a test & start it after adding required amount of questions this test will be shown in test center page of all user so that they can take that test.
